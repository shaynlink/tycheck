# Express API / Server example

> For start this example you need to build this pachage from root before.
```sh
npm run build

cd example/express

npm start
```

> Something wrong with package ? you can run test from root with:
```sh
npm test
```

If test failed, or you find bug, want improve code, implement new feature, [you can open an issue on github here](https://github.com/shaynlink/tychecker)
